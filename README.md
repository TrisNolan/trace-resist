# TRACE-RESIST
Repository for the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship proposal **TRACE-RESIST: Source-resolved surveillance of antimicrobial resistance using allele-level metagenomics and viral profiling**.

## Purpose
This repository will host analytical workflows, documentation, and example datasets produced during the TRACE-RESIST project. All outputs will follow **FAIR principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) in line with Horizon Europe open science requirements.  

## Planned contents
- Snakemake and containerised workflows for allele-level ARG resolution  
- Scripts for Bayesian source attribution (SourceTracker extensions)  
- Example metadata and synthetic mixture datasets  
- Links to deposited sequencing data in ENA  
- Project documentation and Data Management Plan  

## Open science commitment
- All code will be open-source under a permissive license (MIT).  
- Preprints will be released on bioRxiv prior to peer review.  
- Reproducibility will be ensured through version control and containerisation.
