# TRACE-RESIST
Repository for the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship proposal **TRACE-RESIST: Source-resolved surveillance of antimicrobial resistance**.

## Purpose
This repository will host analytical workflows, documentation, and example datasets produced during the TRACE-RESIST project. All outputs will follow **FAIR principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) in line with Horizon Europe open science requirements.  

## Open science commitment
- Code and workflows will be released under an open-source license.  
- Sequencing data will be deposited in appropriate public repositories (e.g., ENA) with metadata.  
- Preprints will be shared on open platforms (e.g., bioRxiv) to ensure early access and transparency.  
- Reproducibility will be supported through version control and containerisation.
